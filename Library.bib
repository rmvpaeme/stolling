We used the system to establish normal ranges for CTs in healthy children, adults and neonates. Mean CTs of healthy children were independent of the needle gauge used (21G or 23CG) for blood sampling; they were very similar to the mean CTs of healthy adults, but longer than mean CTs of healthy neonates. Although children with haemophilia had normal CTs, the PFA-100 system was found to be potentially useful in screening for von Willebrand disease in children.},

Summary: Background The association between thrombophilia and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) associated with central venous catheter (CVC) use, the most important pediatric risk factor for thrombosis, is unclear in children. Pediatric studies with small sample sizes have reported conflicting results. We sought to evaluate whether, among children with CVCs, thrombophilia increases the risk of CVC-associated DVT (CADVT). Materials and methods We systematically searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Web of Science, the Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials, PubMed and reference lists for controlled studies published from the inception of the database until September 2015. Included were studies of children aged {$<$}21 years with CVCs who were systematically tested for thrombophilic traits that are commonly screened for in clinical practice. Pooled prevalence rates and pooled odds ratios (pORs) of CADVT with thrombophilia were estimated by use of a random effects model. Results We analyzed 16 cohort studies with 1279 children, 277 of whom had CADVT, and with 12 traits tested. There was significant heterogeneity in the included studies. The presence of one or more traits was associated with CADVT (pOR 3.20; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.56--6.54). Although the prevalence of most traits was {$<$} 0.10, children with protein C deficiency, elevated factor VIII levels and the FV Leiden mutation had an increased prevalence of CADVT. The association with thrombophilia seemed to be stronger for symptomatic CADVT (pOR 6.71; 95\% CI 1.93--23.37) than for asymptomatic CADVT (pOR 2.14; 95\% CI 1.10--4.18). Conclusions On the basis of the low prevalence of specific traits, the relatively weak association with CADVT, and the limitations of the included studies, we cannot recommend routine testing of thrombophilias in children with CADVT.},

  abstract = {Managing patients on anticoagulation and anti-aggregation therapy is a daily challenge for physicians. The interruption of therapy can increase the risk of thrombotic events during and after surgery. However, the non-interruption of these medications can heighten the risk of bleeding during surgery and trigger a sequence of undesirable outcomes ranging from minor to uncontrolled bleeding. The optimal management of these patients is thus achieved through a balance between thromboembolic and bleeding risks. Several case-based considerations affect whether or not to interrupt anticoagulation or anti-aggregation therapy before surgery. These include evaluating an individual's underlying bleeding risk, the risk of bleeding associated with the surgical procedure, the timing of interruption and resumption of anticoagulation therapy, and whether to use bridging therapy. These are all typical questions that can be addressed in this topic.},
