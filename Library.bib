  abstract = {The PFA-100 system provides an in-vitro method of assessing primary platelet-related haemostasis by measuring the time (the closure time, or CT) taken for a platelet plug to occlude a microscopic aperture cut into a membrane coated with collagen and either epinephrine or ADP. We used the system to establish normal ranges for CTs in healthy children, adults and neonates. Mean CTs of healthy children were independent of the needle gauge used (21G or 23CG) for blood sampling; they were very similar to the mean CTs of healthy adults, but longer than mean CTs of healthy neonates. Although children with haemophilia had normal CTs, the PFA-100 system was found to be potentially useful in screening for von Willebrand disease in children.},

  abstract = {Managing patients on anticoagulation and anti-aggregation therapy is a daily challenge for physicians. The interruption of therapy can increase the risk of thrombotic events during and after surgery. However, the non-interruption of these medications can heighten the risk of bleeding during surgery and trigger a sequence of undesirable outcomes ranging from minor to uncontrolled bleeding. The optimal management of these patients is thus achieved through a balance between thromboembolic and bleeding risks. Several case-based considerations affect whether or not to interrupt anticoagulation or anti-aggregation therapy before surgery. These include evaluating an individual's underlying bleeding risk, the risk of bleeding associated with the surgical procedure, the timing of interruption and resumption of anticoagulation therapy, and whether to use bridging therapy. These are all typical questions that can be addressed in this topic.},
